## Input

For the * -> Romaji games, just type the romaji in the input bar. If you're correct, the ticker will
advance. If you're incorrect, it won't advance. There is no feedback to let you know you're
incorrect. This'll allow you to make as many mistakes as you want until you get it right with no
penalty except taking time.

For the Romaji -> * games, press the space bar to advance the ticker. The objective of this game is
for you to practice your writing, so just write down the letters on physical paper and don't cheat!

Press `.` (period) to cancel out the time recording for the current character. The first input's
timing is always ignored.
